# Mission To Mars

## Overview

Using flask and python, I've created an app that will scrape certain websites for data about Mars.

The website is mobile adaptive. Using bootrap elements I've changed the "Scape" button to red (for the red planet), and gave the mars facts table striped rows for ease of visability.
